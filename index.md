Hi!

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/) of [UC San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu). I am currently working in [Existential Robotics Lab](https://erl.ucsd.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. Nikolay Atanasov. My research interest is broad and multidisplinary. Currently, I focus on perception and mapping. Before this, I also explored other research topics like path planning, large language model. Yeap! I am a fan of intelligent systems like robots!

Prior to my studies at UC San Diego, I received my B.S. degree in the [Physics Department](https://phys.fudan.edu.cn/eng/main.htm) of [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). During my undergraduate, I did research mainly in two areas, design and implementation of experiment systems for physics and SoC (System-on-Chip) software development. I like to share ideas and experiences with others. Please feel free to explore this website and reach out to me if you like to discuss with me.
