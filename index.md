Because of the popularity of iOS, as a language used for iOS App development, `Swift` is getting more and more popular.

Here are my notes about `Swift`.

## Camel Microelectronic

### CamelStudioX

`CamelStudioX` is an IDE for Camel Microelectronic's products. We can create a project, write C language code, compile the code to an image and then upload it to a chip designed by Camel Microelectronic. What's more, we can use an integrated serial tool to run the program we upload to the chip.

Now, I develop a `macOS` version CamelStudioX in `Swift`. You can visit the [repository](https://github.com/daizhirui/CamelStudioX_Mac) of this software to learn something about macOS Application programming.

You can also download this macOS version [here](https://github.com/daizhirui/CamelStudioX_Mac/releases/latest).

### CamelStudioX Library

This library is designed for M2, a MIPS embedded system. Except some modules designed specially for M2, there are also some useful softwares that can be transplant to other platforms, e.g. DES(Data Encryption Standard).
