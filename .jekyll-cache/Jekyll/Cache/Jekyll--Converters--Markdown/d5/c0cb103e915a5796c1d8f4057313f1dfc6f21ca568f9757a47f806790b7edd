<p>Hi!</p>

<p>I am a graduate student from UC San Diego Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. I am currently working in <a href="http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/">SVCL Lab</a> under the supervision of Prof. Nuno Vasconcelos. My research interest is broad and multidisplinary. Currently, I focus on deep learning and computer vision. My research aims to build a privacy-presevered system to detect public area where people are violating the social distancing to help fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Before this, I also explored other research topics like path planning. Yeap! I am a fan of intelligent systems like robots!</p>

<p>Prior to my studies at UC San Diego, I earned my B.S. degree in the Physics Department of Fudan University. During my undergraduate, I did research mainly in two areas, design and implementation of experiment systems for physics and SoC (System-on-Chip) software development. I like to share ideas and experiences with others. Please feel free to explore this website and reach out to me if you like to discuss with me.</p>
