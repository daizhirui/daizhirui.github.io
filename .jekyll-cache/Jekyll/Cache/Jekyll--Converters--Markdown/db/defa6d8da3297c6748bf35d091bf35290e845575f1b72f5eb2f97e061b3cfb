<p>In labs, many systems are based on 3-DOF scanning platform which is able to move a loaded object along three axes: X, Y and Z. For example, 3D printer, laser cutter, painter, etc. Considering the demand in the physics teaching lab where students need plenty of 3-DOF tools to process materials or do measurements, we built a 3-DOF scanning platform for multiple purposes. The system supports Grbl which is widely used in industry. We tested the system as a magnetic field scanner and a sculpturing machine (CNC).</p>
