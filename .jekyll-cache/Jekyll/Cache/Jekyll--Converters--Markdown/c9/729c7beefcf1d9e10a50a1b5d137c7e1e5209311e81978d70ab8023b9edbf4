<h2 id="why-it-came-to-the-world">Why It Came to the World</h2>

<p>When I was taking the course of SoC as a sophomore, I found there was no IDE for developing the targeted SoC on my MacBook Pro. As a geek, I launched this project and finished it independently. So, CamelStudio X was borned! Now, students can use CamelStudio X for learning how to programming the embedded system in the course on their favorite macOS devices.</p>

<h2 id="core-modules">Core Modules</h2>

<p>To make CamelStudio X an IDE for hardware development, a bunch of essential modules are required.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cross compiler toolchains for compiling the source code into machine code for the target platform</li>
  <li>A make system for coordinating compiler tools</li>
  <li>ELF converter that can generate the firmware for the targeted embedded system by analyzing the compiler output</li>
  <li>Serial port communication interface that can transmit data between the embeded system and the upper computer</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="simple-and-user-friendly-ui">Simple and User-friendly UI</h3>

<p>CamelStudio X is a beautiful IDE. Its UI supports automatic dark theme adaptation. The editor supports syntax highlighting for C, C++, and assembly. The UI is kept as concise as possible to lower the learning threshold.</p>

<h3 id="detailed-and-well-arranged-project-setting-page">Detailed and Well-arranged Project Setting Page</h3>

<p>A project of embedded system software can be very complicated. CamelStudio X provides a carefully designed project setting page so that users do not have to write their own Makefile to tell the make system how to compile the source files.</p>

<h3 id="powerful-serial-tool">Powerful Serial Tool</h3>

<p>CamelStudio X provides a serial tool which supports</p>

<ul>
  <li>uploading program</li>
  <li>switching the chip from the root menu to the targeted program</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="github">Github</h2>

<p>CamelStudio X is open-sourced. It is not only an excellent IDE but also a good example of software engineering if you are interested in how an IDE is developed.</p>
