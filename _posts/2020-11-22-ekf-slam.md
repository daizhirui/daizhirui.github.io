# Visual-inertial SLAM with Extended Kalman Filter

Particle filter SLAM is still prone to noise and requires careful hyperparameters fine tune. By contrast, EKF filter is robust to noise because it tracks along the history of control and observation. The experiment results show that EKF is robost to the noise and requires much less hyperparameter adjustment work. [Link](/assets/pdfs/ekf_slam.pdf)
