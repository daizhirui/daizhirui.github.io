# Ultrasonic Blood Flow Field Measuring System

Ultrasound is a helpful noninvasive technology widely used in clinical applications. For example, B-scan is an ultrasound technology that can be used to check unborn children. Nowadays, many elder people are suffering from hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and other diseases. Blood flow is an important figure to indicate the development of patient's disease. Aiming to measure the blood flow field, we built a prototype system to explore methods to measure the blood flow efficiently. With this prototype system, we observe the blood flow speed distribution. This project is done in Fudan University. The paper is in Chinese. [Link](/assets/pdfs/bs-thesis.pdf)
