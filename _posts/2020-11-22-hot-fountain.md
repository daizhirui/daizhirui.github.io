# Study of the Physical process of the Pipette Hot Fountain

One good experiment to show how gas is heated and expands is the hot fountain experiment, in which a fountain is produced by turning a mole tube containing some hot water upside down. Some experiment data can be gotten by analyzing the video which is produced when we are doing the experiment with a set of partly mechanized devices. Also, based on Fourier heat transfer and equal pressure expansion, we build up a model to explain the relation between the height of the fountain and the temperature. And we compare the theoretical results and experiment results. The paper is in Chinese. [Link](/assets/pdfs/hot-fountain.pdf)
